## 🌐 Next Steps to Deploy

### Quick Deployment (5 minutes):
1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub.com
   - Create new public repository
   - Don't initialize with any files

2. **Push Your Code**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Flutter web app"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings
   - Navigate to Pages section
   - Select "Deploy from branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Save settings

4. **Access Your App**
   - Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/`
   - Usually takes 2-5 minutes to deploy

### Alternative: Use Automated Script
Run the PowerShell script we created:
```powershell
.\deploy-to-github.ps1
```
