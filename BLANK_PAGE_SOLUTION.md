# ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: Blank Page Issue Fixed!

## 🔍 **The Issue**
Your Flutter web app was showing a blank page on GitHub Pages due to:

1. **Incorrect Base Href**: The app was looking for files at the wrong path
2. **Missing Firebase Configuration**: Firebase was not properly initialized
3. **Path Configuration**: GitHub Pages serves from `/Android_Web/` but app expected `/`

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### 1. Fixed Base Href Configuration
**Before**: `<base href="/">`  
**After**: `<base href="/Android_Web/">`

This tells Flutter to look for assets at the correct GitHub Pages path.

### 2. Updated Firebase Initialization
Added proper error handling and explicit Firebase options import:
```dart
import 'firebase_options.dart';

await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

### 3. Rebuilt with Correct Parameters
Used the `--base-href` flag during build:
```bash
flutter build web --release --base-href /Android_Web/
```

## 🎉 **Result**
Your app is now working correctly at:
